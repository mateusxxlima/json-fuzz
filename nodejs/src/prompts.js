    return `You are a software test analyst who needs to test a JSON schema validator. Given a JSON schema, your task is to generate ${n} JSON examples that are valid for that schema and are intended to test both simple and edge cases. You must consider covering a wide range of possibilities, including optional fields, nested structures, boundary values, and any other complex or ambiguous rules that could potentially cause errors in the validation process. The goal is to test the strengths and weaknesses of the schema validator by creating challenging examples that explore edge cases, variations, and combinations of data that might break less robust implementations. Please respond to me just an array containing ${n} JSON documents, and please, the array must be a valid JSON to be parsed by JSON.parse() of javaScript.`;
