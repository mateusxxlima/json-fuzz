# Using Large Language Models for Automated Testing of JSON Schema Validation Libraries

## Project Description

The project makes requests to the ChatGPT API, passing a specific JSON Schema to it. The API response is an array of JSON documents, valid to the provided schema.

These documents are then validated using five different JSON Schema validation libraries, all downloaded from npm. The goal is to identify if any document generates validation conflicts between the libraries â€” that is, if one library considers the document valid while another considers it invalid. This differential testing approach can reveal bugs and inconsistencies in the validation libraries.

## Validation Libraries Used

The five libraries used for validation, organized by weekly download numbers, are:

1. [Ajv JSON schema validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv) - 116,749,245 weekly downloads
2. [@exodus/schemasafe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@exodus/schemasafe) - 1,699,810 weekly downloads
3. [@cfworker/json-schema](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cfworker/json-schema) - 128,547 weekly downloads
4. [json-schema-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-schema-library) - 114,501 weekly downloads
5. [@hyperjump/json-schema](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperjump/json-schema) - 67,666 weekly downloads

These download figures were obtained from the NPM website on October 25, 2024 to provide an updated comparison of the libraries.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to conduct differential testing, meaning to compare validation results across different libraries. If a JSON document generated by the LLM is considered valid by one library but invalid by another, it will indicate an inconsistency between the validators and potentially reveal a bug in one of the implementations.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for JavaScript.
- **JavaScript**: The main programming language of the project.
- **ChatGPT API**: Used for generating JSON documents based on JSON Schema.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Add your OPENAI_API_KEY to the .env file.
4. At the start of the Main function, you can configure the GPT language model to be used, the number of documents to be generated by the LLM per request, and the total number of documents you expect for each JSON Schema.
5. Run the main script (`npm start`) to generate and validate JSON documents with the five libraries and capture potential inconsistencies.

## Final Considerations

This project allows testing the robustness of JSON Schema validators, helping to identify potential flaws or inconsistencies across popular libraries. Combining LLMs with differential validation provides an innovative way to evaluate software tools and ensure greater accuracy in JSON Schema implementations.
